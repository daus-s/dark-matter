# dark-matter
dark matter simulation for gci(Grand challenges initiative)

The project is a simulation relying on simple classical mechanics to define gravitational attraction and repulsion.
The idea of the simulation is to create a program with manipulable variables to create the most accurate system with
respect to the known structure of galaxies and celestial bodies. 

The math and full project is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtSQh4-2K8I3q_3AYgsElrQgBbxCq4rzA4C7TX8ZJOw/edit
